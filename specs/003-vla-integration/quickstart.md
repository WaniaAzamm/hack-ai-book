# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

## Overview
This module teaches students how to integrate voice commands, language models, and robot actions using Whisper, LLMs, and ROS 2.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with voice recognition systems
- Knowledge of Large Language Models

## Learning Path
1. Start with the Whisper voice processing chapter to understand voice-to-text conversion
2. Move to LLM-based planning to learn how natural language is converted to action plans
3. Complete with ROS 2 action execution to see how plans are executed on robots

## Key Outcomes
- Students will be able to process voice commands using Whisper
- Students will generate action plans using LLMs
- Students will execute plans as ROS 2 actions
