Created three comprehensive chapters: Isaac Sim for Photoreal Simulation & Synthetic Data (850 words), Isaac ROS for VSLAM & Navigation (902 words), and Nav2 Path Planning for Bipedal Movement (1058 words). All chapters include learning objectives, practical exercises, academic citations, and assessment questions as specified in the requirements. Updated the sidebar navigation to include the new module, and verified that the Docusaurus build completes successfully with the new content. The implementation follows academic standards with proper citations and maintains the required content structure for the educational textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics."
outcome: "Module 3 successfully implemented with three comprehensive chapters covering NVIDIA Isaac technologies for robotics education. All content meets academic standards and integrates properly with the Docusaurus documentation framework."
evaluation: "All tasks completed successfully. Word counts exceed minimum requirements (500 words per chapter). Academic citations included. Navigation properly integrated. Build verified."
