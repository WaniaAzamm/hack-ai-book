# Docusaurus Framework Selection ADR

## User Input

Docusaurus Framework Selection for Academic Textbook

## Response Summary

Created an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documenting the decision to use Docusaurus as the framework for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. The ADR captures the architectural decision with context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

The ADR documents the choice of Docusaurus 3.x with Markdown content, academic-focused navigation, and Node.js runtime as the optimal solution for meeting academic content standards while providing modern documentation features.

## Outcome

The architectural decision to use Docusaurus for the academic textbook has been formally documented in ADR-1, providing a clear record of the rationale, alternatives considered, and implications of this technology choice for future reference and team alignment.
